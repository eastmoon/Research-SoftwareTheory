## Dataflow architecture

### Layer

The Layer architectural pattern helps to structure applications that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks in which each group of subtasks is at a particular level of abstraction.

**A large system that requires decomposition**

### Pipe & Filter

The Pipes and Filters architectural pattern provides a structure for systems that process a stream of data. Each Processing step is encapsulated in a filter component. Data is passed through pipes between adjacent filters. Recombining filters allows you to build families of related systems.

**Processing data streams.**

### Blackboard

The Blackboard architectural pattern is useful for problems for which no deterministic solution strategies are known. In blackboard several specialized subsystems assemble their knowledge to build a possibly partial or approximate solution.

**An immature domain in which no closed approach to a solution is known or feasible.**
